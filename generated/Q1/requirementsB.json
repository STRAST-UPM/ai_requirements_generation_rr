      "project_entities_relation": "The cybersecurity requirement \"Help messages during the log-on procedure must not aid an unauthorized user, e.g., by indicating which parts of the data are correct or incorrect.\" is related to the concept of User Authentication and is applicable to multiple entities within the project domain, specifically focusing on the roles that interact with the system:\n\n\tSystem Admin: This role deals with the physical and logical IT infrastructure of the factory, ensuring that all employees can perform their duties. During the log-on procedure, if help messages are too informative, they could potentially reveal patterns or requirements that an attacker could exploit to gain unauthorized access.\n\tOperations Manager: This role oversees the production process, performing recurring tasks, optimizing inefficiencies, and coordinating machinery. If the operations manager encounters issues during the log-on procedure, non-generic error messages could inadvertently disclose information about the system's authentication mechanism.\n\tSecurity Manager: This role implements and oversees security procedures and events, taking the necessary measures to handle them in a timely manner. The security manager's access to sensitive information makes it crucial that the log-on procedure does not leak any information that could be used by attackers.\n\tAccess Control Manager: Responsible for managing the Access Gate, this role verifies and registers the entry of supply vehicles. If the access control manager's log-on procedure reveals details about the correctness of entered credentials, it could assist unauthorized users in attempting to gain access to the system.\n\tDock Manager: Overseeing operations at the Dock, the dock manager manages the unloading of components from supply vehicles. Ensuring that help messages during the log-on procedure do not aid unauthorized users is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the system.\n\tWarehouse Manager: This role is responsible for managing the warehouse operations, organizing the storage of components, maintaining stock levels, and coordinating the distribution of components to the assembly line. The warehouse manager's access to the system must be protected, and help messages during log-on should not reveal any information that could assist unauthorized users.\n\tPlant Manager: Overseeing the entire factory, the plant manager coordinates operations between different departments, ensures production targets are met, and maintains quality standards. Protecting the plant manager's log-on procedure from revealing sensitive information is vital for the overall security of the factory's operations.\n\tShipping Manager: This role is responsible for managing the shipping of cars towards the dealer. The shipping manager's access to the system must be safeguarded, and help messages during the log-on procedure should not aid unauthorized users in gaining access.\n\tEmployees in General: Any employee who uses the system for their tasks must have a secure log-on procedure. Help messages that do not indicate which parts of the data are correct or incorrect prevent unauthorized users from learning how to bypass security measures.\n\nIn summary, the requirement is applicable to all roles that require logging into the system to perform their duties.

Sensitive data is transmitted across this network, necessitating encryption to protect it from interception.\n\tIoT Middleware Platform Network: The network used by the IoT middleware platforms (e.g., ThingsBoard) to communicate with sensors and actuators. Cryptographic measures are essential to secure this communication channel.\n\tExternal Networks: Connections to external systems, such as those used by the Forwarder, OEMs, Material Providers, or Dealers for exchanging data like Purchase Orders, Requisitions, Delivery Notes, or Waybills. Encryption ensures that this information is not exposed during transmission.\n\nInformation Stored:\n\n\tProduction Plan Data Store: Contains sensitive information about the daily production schedule, which if accessed by unauthorized parties, could disrupt operations or reveal trade secrets.\n\tWarehouse Inventory: Holds details about the stock levels and locations of Components, which is valuable information that competitors or cybercriminals might target.\n\tFinished Car Registry: Records the unique identities and statuses of finished Cars, which could be misused if accessed without authorization.\n\tPurchase Order and Transport Order Data Stores: Store details about Car orders and shipping arrangements, which are critical for business operations and must be protected from interception or alteration.\n\nThe requirement emphasizes the importance of implementing cryptographic measures to protect data at rest on endpoint devices and storage media, as well as data in transit over networks. This is particularly relevant for the AI4I4 project due to the high volume of sensitive data exchanged and stored across various subsystems and external entities.",

      "project_entities_relation": "The cybersecurity requirement to establish a comprehensive key management system, including procedures for generating and protecting cryptographic keys and recovering encrypted data in case of lost, compromised, or damaged keys, is applicable to multiple entities and concepts within the AI4I4 project domain.\n\nCryptographic Keys: Cryptographic keys are used across various entities in the project to secure communication and data. They are crucial for securing data transmitted between the Factory, Dealers, and the Logistics Terminal. Additionally, keys are essential for securing data stored in the various data stores mentioned, such as the Requisitions Data Store, the Warehouse Inventory, the Finished Car Registry, the Production Plan Data Store, and the Purchase Order and Transport Order Data Stores.\n\nEncrypted Data: Encrypted data refers to any sensitive information that needs protection. This includes data about Requisitions, Supply Vehicles, Components, Cars, Employees, Managers, Dealers, Purchase Orders, Transport Orders, and other logistic information. The encrypted data is stored in the data stores mentioned above and is transmitted between entities during the inbound logistics, Car assembly, and outbound logistics processes.\n\nKey Recovery Procedures: Key recovery procedures are necessary for scenarios where keys are lost, compromised, or damaged. This requirement is particularly important for entities that handle sensitive data, such as the Access Control Manager, the Dock Manager, the Warehouse Manager, the Plant Manager, the Finished Car Yard Manager, and the Shipping Manager. These procedures ensure that data remains accessible even if keys are unavailable due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nIn summary, the key management system requirement is directly related to the cybersecurity of data and communication channels used by the Factory, Dealers, Logistics Terminal, and all the internal processes and entities within the Factory, including the Warehouse, the Assembly Line, the Finished Car Yard, and the Access Gate. The requirement ensures that sensitive data remains protected and that data access can be restored in case of key-related issues.",
