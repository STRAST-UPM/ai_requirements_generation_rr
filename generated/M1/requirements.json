      "project_entities_relation": "The cybersecurity requirement \"Network administration channels must be segregated from other network traffic\" is related to the entities and concepts of the domain, specifically to the network infrastructure and communication channels used within the car factory.\n\nIn the context of the project specification, the network administration channels refer to the communication channels used by the System admin, Operations manager, and Security manager to manage and oversee the IT infrastructure, production process, and security procedures, respectively. These channels are crucial for ensuring the smooth operation of the factory and maintaining the security of the system.\n\nOn the other hand, other network traffic refers to the communication channels used by various IoT devices, sensors, actuators, and other components of the system to exchange data and perform their respective functions. This includes communication between AGVs, robots, RFID readers, and other devices used for automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technologies.\n\nSegregating network administration channels from other network traffic is essential to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and to ensure the availability and integrity of the network infrastructure. This requirement is particularly important in the context of the project, as the factory relies heavily on IoT devices and AIDC technologies, which could be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats if not properly managed and isolated from the rest of the network traffic.\n\nTherefore, this cybersecurity requirement is applicable and relevant to the project, as it ensures the secure and efficient operation of the car factory by segregating network administration channels from other network traffic.",
