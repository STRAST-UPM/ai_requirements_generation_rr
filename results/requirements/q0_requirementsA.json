Examples of such information include:\n\n\tRequisitions data, including details of components and materials required for production.\n\tWarehouse inventory data, including the location, quantity, and status of parts and materials.\n\tFinished Car registry data, including details of the finished cars, their unique identifiers, and their status.\n\tPurchase order and transport order data, including details of orders placed by dealers and the logistics of car dispatch.\n\tSupply vehicles registry data, including details of movements of supply vehicles and components received.\n\nMobile User Endpoint Devices: These are devices used by employees, managers, and workers in the factory for various tasks. Examples include:\n\n\tHandheld devices used by dock managers and warehouse workers for scanning and registering components.\n\tDevices used by assembly line workers for registering quality control checks.\n\tDevices used by the finished car yard manager for managing the storage and retrieval of finished cars.\n\tDevices used by the shipping manager for managing the logistics of car dispatch.\n\nStorage Media: This refers to the physical media used for storing data within the factory's systems. Examples include:\n\n\tDatastores such as the requisitions data store, warehouse inventory, finished car registry, and purchase order and transport order data stores.\n\tPhysical data carriers such as RFID tags or data matrix codes attached to components, parts, and finished cars for identification and tracking purposes.\n\tGeneral-purpose input/output (GPIO) sensors/actuators that can monitor and control physical actions within the manufacturing environment.\n\nNetworks: These are the communication networks used for transmitting data between different systems and devices within the factory and potentially with external entities. Examples include:\n\n\tNetworks connecting the IoT middleware platforms (e.g., ThingsBoard) to the sensors and actuators.\n\tNetworks used for transmitting data between the factory's systems and the dealer's systems for processing purchase orders.\n\tNetworks used for transmitting data between the factory's systems and the forwarder's systems for managing the logistics of car dispatch.\n\nThe requirement implies that cryptographic measures should be implemented to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data stored on endpoint devices and storage media, as well as data transmitted over networks. This could include the use of encryption for data at rest and in transit, secure authentication mechanisms, and secure key management practices to ensure that only authorized users and systems can access and manipulate the data.",
