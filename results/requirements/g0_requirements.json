This is a crucial aspect of user authentication and access control systems, designed to prevent unauthorized access and safeguard sensitive information.\n\nIn the context of the AI4I4 project, this requirement can be directly related to several domain entities and concepts involved in the system's authentication and access control mechanisms. Here are the specific substitutions and relationships:\n\n1. **{log-on procedure}** - This can be related to any system access control mechanism used by employees or systems that require authentication to access sensitive areas or data. This might particularly involve:\n   - **Access Control Manager** who oversees the entry of Supply Vehicles at the Access Gate.\n   - **System admin** who deals with the IT infrastructure and may oversee the processes where employees log onto the system to perform tasks.\n\n2. **{parts of the data}** - This could relate to the specific credentials or authentication data required during log-on procedures. In the AI4I4 project, this can include:\n   - Employee IDs or passwords.\n   - Specific data identifiers used in the authentication of Supply Vehicles or during the check-out of Components.\n   - Any unique identifiers used for logging into the system that manages the flow of Components, Assembly Line operations, or outbound logistics.\n\nIn the project, the authentication process, whether for physical access (like Supply Vehicles entering through the Access Gate) or digital access (like system admins accessing the IT network), must be secure and not provide feedback that could help an unauthorized person refine their attempts to gain access. The requirement ensures that any authentication system used throughout the project does not compromise security by providing too much information during the log-on failure messages.\n\nThus, the requirement to prevent help messages from aiding unauthorized users during the log-on procedure is applicable and relevant to the cybersecurity strategies surrounding the AI4I4 project's access control and authentication systems.",
