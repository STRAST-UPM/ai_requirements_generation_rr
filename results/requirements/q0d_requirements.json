      "project_entities_relation": "The cybersecurity requirement \"Help messages during the log-on procedure must not aid an unauthorized user, e.g., by indicating which parts of the data are correct or incorrect.\" relates to the concept of login authentication within the domain of the AI4I4 project. This requirement is aimed at enhancing the security of the system by preventing unauthorized access attempts from being guided by feedback during the login process.\n\nIn the context of the project, this requirement would apply to the following entities and concepts:\n\n1. **System Admin**: This role is responsible for managing the physical and logical IT infrastructure of the factory. As such, they are likely to have access to the system's administration panel, which requires a secure login mechanism. The requirement ensures that even if an unauthorized user attempts to access the system admin's account, they will not receive any clues about what parts of their login attempt were correct or incorrect.\n\n2. **Operations Manager**: Similarly, the operations manager, who oversees the production process and coordinates machinery, would also require a secure login mechanism to access the system. The requirement prevents unauthorized users from gaining insights into the login credentials of the operations manager.\n\n3. **Security Manager**: The security manager implements and oversees security procedures and events. They too would require a secure login mechanism to access the system, and this requirement ensures that their login process does not inadvertently reveal any information to unauthorized users.\n\n4. **Employee Login Procedures**: Generally, all employees accessing the system would need to follow secure login practices. This requirement ensures that the login process for all employees is designed in a way that does not aid unauthorized users in guessing the correct login credentials.\n\nThe requirement indirectly relates to the concept of \"parts of the data,\" which could refer to different aspects of the login data, such as usernames, passwords, or multi-factor authentication codes. By not providing feedback on which parts of the login data are correct or incorrect, the system makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to determine the correct login credentials through trial and error or brute force attacks. This enhances the overall cybersecurity posture of the AI4I4 project by protecting sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access to the system.",

In the context of the AI4I4 project, this could be associated with the various interfaces used by Employees to interact with the system, such as the front-end application used by the Access Control Manager, Dock Manager, Warehouse Manager, Plant Manager, Finished Car Yard Manager, and other Employees. The log-on controls are crucial for securing access to sensitive information and functionalities within the Factory's operational systems.\n\n2. **{user}**: In this scenario, the {user} refers to the Employee who is attempting to log on to the system. This could include any Employee with a role that requires system access, such as the Access Control Manager, Dock Manager, Warehouse Manager, Plant Manager, Finished Car Yard Manager, Yard Drivers, and other Employees involved in the manufacturing and logistics processes.\n\n3. **{organization's system administrators}**: The {organization's system administrators} would be responsible for managing the IT infrastructure of the Factory. In the context of the AI4I4 project, this role would fall under the System Admin, who deals with the physical and logical IT infrastructure of the factory, ensuring that all Employees can perform their duties. The System Admin would be one of the primary recipients of security alerts related to failed login attempts, as they would be responsible for investigating and mitigating potential security breaches.\n\n### Explanation of the Relationship:\n\nThe requirement ensures that unauthorized access attempts to the system are monitored and that alerts are raised when suspicious activity is detected. This is particularly important in the AI4I4 project, where sensitive information and critical operations are handled. By detecting and responding to potential breaches of log-on controls, the system can protect against unauthorized access to the Factory's operational systems, which could compromise the integrity and confidentiality of data related to manufacturing processes, inventory management, and logistics.\n\nFor example, if an Access Control Manager repeatedly enters incorrect passwords, the system should raise a security event, alerting the user (Access Control Manager) and the System Admin of the issue. This prompt response allows for immediate investigation and corrective action, preventing potential security incidents from escalating.\n\nIn summary, the cybersecurity requirement is directly related to the security of the system interfaces used by various Employees and the IT infrastructure managed by the System Admin. It is designed to enhance the security posture of the AI4I4 project by ensuring that unauthorized access attempts are detected and responded to promptly.",
