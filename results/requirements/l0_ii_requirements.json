This segregation is crucial for ensuring the security and integrity of the system's operations.",
      "project_entities_relation": "Based on the project specification, the cybersecurity requirement \"{Network administration channels} must be segregated from {other network traffic}\" may relate to the following entities or concepts of the domain:\n\n- Network administration channels: This could refer to the communication channels used by the System Admin to manage the physical and logical IT infrastructure of the Factory. It might include the channels used to configure and monitor the IoT middleware platforms (e.g., Thingsboard) that connect sensors and actuators.\n- Other network traffic: This could refer to the communication channels used for other purposes, such as the production process, logistics, or other business operations. For example, it might include the communication between the Warehouse Manager and the Warehouse Workers, or the communication between the Shipping Manager and the Forwarder.\n\nThe relationship between the requirement and the domain entities or concepts is that the segregation of network administration channels from other network traffic is necessary to prevent unauthorized access or interference with the system's administration and management procedures. This is particularly important in a Factory setting where the system's availability and integrity are critical to the production process.\n\nBy segregating network administration channels, the system can reduce the risk of cyber attacks or unauthorized access to sensitive information, ensuring that the System Admin can perform their duties securely and efficiently. This, in turn, helps to maintain the overall security and reliability of the system, which is essential for the Factory's operations.",
