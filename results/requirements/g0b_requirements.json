      "project_entities_relation": "The cybersecurity requirement: \"Help messages during the {log-on procedure} must not aid an unauthorized user, e.g., by indicating which {parts of the data} are correct or incorrect.\" can be associated with several domain entities or concepts within the AI4I4 project. Below is an analysis of the potential relationships:\n\n1. **Log-on Procedure**: This term can be replaced with specific authentication processes that occur at various checkpoints within the AI4I4 system. Key areas might include:\n   - **Access Control Manager**: This role involves verifying and registering the entry of Supply Vehicles at the Access Gate. The log-on procedure could relate to the authentication process that the Access Control Manager follows to verify the identity of drivers and the legitimacy of documents like Delivery Notes.\n   - **System Admin**: As part of managing the IT infrastructure, the System Admin would likely be involved in overseeing the security aspects of log-on procedures across the factory's networked systems. This includes managing access to the various subsystems like the Warehouse Management System or Assembly Line Control System.\n\n2. **Parts of the Data**: This phrase can be associated with specific types of data handled within the factory's systems. For instance:\n   - **Delivery Notes and Requisition Data**: In the context of inbound logistics, during the authentication and log-on processes at the Access Gate, specific pieces of data such as the details in Delivery Notes (which might include items, quantities, etc.) and related Requisition IDs could be considered. The cybersecurity requirement would ensure that if there's an authentication error, the system does not disclose which part of the data (e.g., item list, quantities) matched the records and which did not, thus not aiding potential unauthorized users.\n   - **Employee Identification Data**: For internal system access, such as those used by Warehouse Managers, Assembly Line Workers, or System Admins, ensuring that log-on help messages do not specify which part of the credentials (username, password, security token) were correct or incorrect would be crucial to prevent aiding unauthorized access.\n\n### Explanation of Relationship\nThe relationship between the cybersecurity requirement and these domain entities is centered around the need to protect sensitive operational and authentication-related information within the factory's systems. By ensuring that help messages during log-on procedures do not reveal specific details about what data was correctly or incorrectly entered, the system enhances its security posture against unauthorized access attempts. This is crucial in a complex operational environment like a car manufacturing facility, where access to different parts of the production process needs to be strictly controlled and monitored.",
