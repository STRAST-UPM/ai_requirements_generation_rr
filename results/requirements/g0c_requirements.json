These systems are integral to the management and tracking of Parts, Materials, and finished Cars. Isolating these systems can prevent unauthorized access and ensure the integrity and availability of data critical to the manufacturing and distribution processes.\n\n2. **AIDC Technologies**: Automatic Identification and Data Capture technologies are used throughout the Factory to track and manage the movement of Components, Parts, and finished Cars. These technologies are inherently sensitive as they directly interact with critical operational processes. Ensuring that these systems are isolated from unauthorized physical and logical access is crucial to maintaining the security and efficiency of the manufacturing process.\n\n3. **IoT Middleware Platforms**: As the project relies on IoT middleware platforms (e.g., Thingsboard) to connect various sensors and actuators, these platforms become a critical part of the infrastructure. Isolating these platforms can prevent potential cybersecurity risks that could arise from unauthorized access, such as tampering with sensor data or manipulating control commands.\n\n4. **Finished Car Registry and Logistics Terminal Car Registry**: These registries hold detailed information about each Car's status and location within the Finished Car Yard and Logistics Terminal.

Each of these roles likely has different levels of access and control requirements over the data and systems they interact with.\n\n2. **Access to data**: This generally refers to the interaction with and management of various datastores mentioned in the project, such as the Requisitions Data Store, Supply Vehicles Registry, Warehouse Inventory, Production Plan Data Store, Finished Car Registry, Purchase Order and Transport Order Data Stores. Access to each of these datastores needs to be carefully controlled and restricted based on the roles and responsibilities of the employees to ensure data integrity and security.\n\n### Explanation of Relationships:\n- **Employee Roles and Access Control**: Different employees have varying levels of access depending on their job functions. For example, the Warehouse Manager needs access to the Warehouse Inventory and Production Plan Data Store to manage and coordinate the flow of components, while the Plant Manager might need broader access to oversee overall production and ensure quality standards.\n  \n- **Datastores and Access Control**: Each datastore contains critical and sensitive information that must be protected from unauthorized access.
