Factory: The overall manufacturing facility where the production of cars takes place. The Factory comprises specialized areas for moulding and welding materials, multiple assembly lines, a warehouse, unloading and loading docks, an access gate, and a finished car yard. Restricting and filtering network connections within the Factory ensures that only authorized systems can communicate with each other, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.\n2. IoT middleware platforms: The system will rely on the use of generalist IoT middleware platforms, such as Thingsboard, to which the different sensors and actuators will be connected. These platforms need to be secured by restricting and filtering their network connections, as they handle and process sensitive data from various devices within the factory.\n3. System admin: This role is responsible for managing the physical and logical IT infrastructure of the factory, ensuring that all employees can perform their duties. The system admin must implement and maintain firewalls to restrict and filter network connections, ensuring the security and integrity of the factory's IT systems.\n4. Operations manager: This role oversees the production process, performing recurring tasks, optimizing inefficiencies, and coordinating machinery like AGVs and robots. The operations manager must ensure that the network connections of the systems and devices used in the production process are restricted and filtered using firewalls, to prevent unauthorized access and maintain the smooth operation of the factory.\n5. Security manager: This role implements and oversees security procedures and events, taking the necessary measures to handle them in a timely manner. The security manager must enforce the use of firewalls to restrict and filter network connections, as part of the overall security strategy for the factory.\n\nIn summary, the cybersecurity requirement of restricting and filtering system connections to the network using firewalls is applicable to various domain entities and concepts within the project specification.
