Here's how it maps to entities and concepts from the project specification:\n\n- **Network administration channels**: This refers to the communication channels used for managing and monitoring the network infrastructure. In the context of the AI4I4 project, this would likely involve the System Admin role, who deals with the physical and logical IT infrastructure of the factory, ensuring that all employees can perform their duties. The channels used by the System Admin for maintenance, updates, and monitoring should be segregated to prevent unauthorized access and to protect sensitive operations.\n\n- **Other network traffic**: This encompasses all regular operational network traffic that supports the manufacturing processes, logistics, and business operations. Examples of other network traffic in the AI4I4 project include communication between sensors and actuators for AIDC technologies, data exchange for inventory management, communication for supply vehicle access control, and information sharing between various subsystems for inbound logistics, car assembly, and outbound logistics.\n\nSegregating network administration channels from other network traffic is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the network. It prevents potential attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in regular operational traffic to gain access to critical network management functions. By isolating the network administration channels, the system can limit the impact of security breaches and reduce the risk of unauthorized modifications to the network configuration.\n\nIn summary, segregating network administration channels from other network traffic helps ensure that the System Admin can securely manage the network without interference from operational activities, thereby enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture of the AI4I4 project.",
