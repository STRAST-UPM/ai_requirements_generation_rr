In the context of AI4I4, this could involve various roles such as System Admin, Operations Manager, Security Manager, and other employees accessing the factory's IT systems. The log-on procedure would be critical across various subsystems managing inbound logistics, assembly lines, and outbound logistics, as well as accessing the IoT middleware platform like Thingsboard that integrates sensors and actuators.\n\n2. **{parts of the data}**: This refers to the specific inputs required during the log-on procedure, such as usernames, passwords, or other authentication factors. The requirement indicates that the feedback provided during the log-on attempt should not specify which part of the authentication data (username or password) was entered incorrectly.
