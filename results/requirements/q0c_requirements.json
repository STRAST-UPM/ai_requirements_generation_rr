      "project_entities_relation": "The cybersecurity requirement \"{Connection} of {systems} to the {network} must be restricted and filtered, e.g., using firewalls.\" can be related to multiple entities and concepts within the AI4I4 project domain. Here are some possible interpretations:\n\n1. **Connection of Factory Systems to the Network**: This refers to the various systems within the factory, such as the AIDC technologies (RFID tags, data matrix codes, GPIO sensors/actuators), the front-end applications used by Employees, the access control systems at the Access Gate, the systems controlling the movement of AGVs, and the systems used for quality control. All these systems must connect securely to the factory network, and their connections should be restricted and filtered using firewalls to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n2. **Connection of External Systems to the Network**: This involves systems from external entities, such as the systems used by Providers for tracking deliveries, or the systems used by Forwarders for logistics and transportation. When these systems need to interact with the factory network (e.g., for transmitting Delivery Notes, Purchase Orders, Transport Orders, or Waybills), their connections should also be restricted and filtered to ensure that only authorized communications occur.\n\n3. **Connection of IoT Middleware Platforms to the Network**: Given that the system relies on generalist IoT middleware platforms (e.g., ThingsBoard), these platforms must be securely connected to the network. Their connections should be restricted and filtered using firewalls to protect against cyber threats and unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n4. **Connection of Logistics Terminal Systems to the Network**: Since the Logistics Terminal is operated by a different company (the Forwarder) but is physically close to the factory, there might be instances where systems within the Logistics Terminal need to interact with the factory network. The connection between these systems should be restricted and filtered to maintain network security.\n\n5. **Connection of User Management Systems to the Network**: The systems responsible for user management, such as those used by the System Admin, Operations Manager, and Security Manager, must also connect securely to the network. Their connections should be restricted and filtered to ensure that only authorized users can access the system and perform their duties.\n\nIn summary, the requirement pertains to the secure connection of various systems to the network, including internal factory systems, external systems, IoT middleware platforms, Logistics Terminal systems, and user management systems.
