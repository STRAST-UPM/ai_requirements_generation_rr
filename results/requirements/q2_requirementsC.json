Here's how the requirement maps to the project's entities and concepts:\n\nCryptographic Keys: These keys are essential for securing data and communications across various systems and processes within the Factory. Given that the project heavily relies on IoT technologies and automated systems, cryptographic keys play a critical role in securing data transmission, access control, and data integrity. This requirement is particularly pertinent to the Access Gate, Dock, Warehouse, Assembly Line, and Finished Car Yard where automated identification and data capture (AIDC) technologies are employed. The use of RFID tags, data matrix codes, and other AIDC technologies necessitates secure key management to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data.\n\nEncrypted Data: This refers to data that has been transformed using encryption algorithms to prevent unauthorized access. Encrypted data is likely to be present in various data stores and systems within the Factory, such as the Requisitions Data Store, Supply Vehicles Registry, Warehouse Inventory, Production Plan Data Store, Finished Car Registry, Logistics Terminal Car Registry, and Purchase Order and Transport Order Data Stores. The requirement to recover encrypted data in case of lost, compromised, or damaged keys is crucial for maintaining the availability and integrity of this data.\n\nKey Recovery Procedures: These procedures are vital for addressing situations where cryptographic keys are lost, compromised, or damaged. Key recovery mechanisms should be established to ensure that encrypted data can still be accessed and decrypted when necessary. This is particularly important for sensitive data that is stored or transmitted within the Factory, such as financial transactions, personal employee data, and confidential manufacturing details. The System Admin, Operations Manager, and Security Manager would be responsible for implementing and overseeing these procedures.\n\nUser Management: The requirement indirectly relates to user management, as proper key management involves controlling access to cryptographic keys. This is especially relevant for the System Admin, Operations Manager, and Security Manager roles, who are responsible for managing user permissions and ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to cryptographic keys and encrypted data.\n\nSystem Operation: Key management is also crucial for system operation, as it affects the reliability and security of the various systems used in the Factory, including the AIDC systems, IoT middleware platforms, and any software applications that handle sensitive data.\n\nSecurity Management: This requirement is directly linked to security management practices within the Factory. The Security Manager would be responsible for implementing and enforcing key management policies to prevent data breaches and ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.\n\nIn summary, the comprehensive key management system requirement impacts multiple aspects of the Factory's operations, from securing data at rest and in transit to ensuring the availability of encrypted data and maintaining the integrity of automated systems. It is closely tied to the roles of System Admin, Operations Manager, and Security Manager, as well as the various data stores and automated processes within the Factory.",
