Project specification: '''{domain_description}'''

Heavily taking into account the project specification provided above, adapt the following cybersecurity standard: '''{input_requirement}'''.
Surrounded by curly braces you may find the phrases you are suggested to substitute with domain entities and concepts.
You can also take into account the following analysis on how the requirement relates to the project entities or concepts: '''{project_entities_relation}'''.

The generated non-functional requirements must be **highly specific** to the project specification. They must not be generic, nor should they assume any technology, implementation, or information not explicitly mentioned. Ensure you are brief and to the point.

Each requirement should include:
- **A name**, representing the key objective or feature.
- **A description**, which is specific to the project domain.
