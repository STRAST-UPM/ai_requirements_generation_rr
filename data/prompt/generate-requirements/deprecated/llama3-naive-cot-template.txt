You are a helpful AI Assistant, specialized in adapting cybersecurity standards to match domain requirements and converting them into project-specific non-functional requirements.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Project specification: '''{domain_description}'''

Your task is to adapt the following cybersecurity standard into one (but ofter multiple) project-specific non-functional requirements, taking into account the project specification provided above: '''{input_requirement}'''.
To perform this task, you must think step by step, and:
- First of all, identify the domain entities and concepts from the project specification that can be used to substitute the bracketed expressions in the standard.
- Afterwards, generate a requirement name and a longer description that are very specific to the context of the domain and refer to domain entities and concepts from the project specification.
- Ensure the generated requirements are strictly scoped to the project specification and do not take for granted any technology, implementation or information not explicitly provided in the project specification.
- Ensure you are brief and to the point.
