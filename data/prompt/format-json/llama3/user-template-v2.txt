Guidelines:
- The only return required are the formatted requirements.
- Each requirement must be specified in a JSON-compliant format in the following way:
'''json
{{
  "name": "Requirement name",
  "description": "A more extensive requirement description, specific for the context of the domain using domain entities and domain jargon"
}}
'''
- Ensure the JSON output is valid and parsable.
- Use descriptive and concise names for the requirements. Do not use numbering schemes (e.g., "NFR-1").
- Pay special attention to quotes, commas, and the correct usage and spelling of domain-specific entities and jargon.

Requirements document: '''{requirements_document}'''

Adapt the provided document into one or more non-functional domain requirements. Return only the formatted JSON output.
